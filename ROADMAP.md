# Jekyll Pandoc Exports - Future Development Phases

## Phase 4 (Test Coverage Completion)
*Focus: Complete unit and integration test coverage*

- [ ] Collection processing integration tests
- [ ] File generation workflow tests (with Pandoc mocking)
- [ ] End-to-end conversion pipeline tests
- [ ] Dependency validation integration tests

## Phase 5 (Essential Documentation)
*Focus: Critical user documentation and examples*

- [ ] Advanced configuration examples
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Integration examples with popular themes
- [ ] Performance optimization tips

## Phase 6 (File Management)
*Focus: Better file handling and naming*

- [ ] Custom filename patterns (date, title, slug options)
- [ ] File conflict handling strategies (overwrite, skip, version)
- [ ] Output file organization (by date, category, collection)

## Phase 7 (Configuration Flexibility)
*Focus: Per-content and collection-specific settings*

- [ ] Per-collection configuration settings
- [ ] Front matter override system
- [ ] Tag/category-based export rules

## Phase 8 (Content Filtering)
*Focus: Selective export capabilities*

- [ ] Collection filtering options (tags, categories, custom fields)
- [ ] Conditional exports based on build environment
- [ ] Content-type specific templates

## Phase 9 (Quality Assurance)
*Focus: Testing and validation*

- [ ] Integration tests with sample Jekyll sites
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility tests
- [ ] Export validation and verification

## Phase 10 (Developer Tools)
*Focus: CLI and API enhancements*

- [ ] Preview generation tools
- [ ] Export validation commands
- [ ] API for programmatic access

## Phase 11 (System Integration)
*Focus: Environment and dependency management*

- [ ] Environment-specific configurations
- [ ] Version compatibility warnings for dependencies
- [ ] Dynamic configuration via liquid tags

## Phase 12 (Performance Optimization)
*Focus: Speed and memory improvements*

- [ ] Memory management for large files
- [ ] Parallel processing for multiple exports
- [ ] Recovery strategies for partial failures

## Phase 13 (Advanced Formats)
*Focus: Extended Pandoc capabilities*

- [ ] Support for all Pandoc output formats
- [ ] Metadata injection (author, date, version)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

## Implementation Priority

**Current Status:** Production ready with comprehensive feature set (Phases 1-3 complete)

**Recommended Next Steps:**

1. **Phase 4** - Test Coverage Completion (ensure reliability)
2. **Phase 5** - Essential Documentation (highest impact for users)
3. **Phase 6** - File Management (common user pain points)
4. **Phase 7** - Configuration Flexibility (power user needs)
5. **Phase 8+** - Advanced features based on community feedback

**Phase Sizing:** Each phase contains 3-4 related work items for focused development cycles

**Development Approach:**

- Each phase builds on previous functionality
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Comprehensive testing for each phase
- Community feedback integration
